    <h2>About</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>My name is Tristan and I am learning code. I reside on the east coast of North America with my partner of 5 years and my 2 dogs, Lincoln and Mary. 
          I enjoy listening to records for samples, and just in general, as well as tinkering with samplers, drum machines and keyboards.I also Enjoy gaming and puzzles.
          Code the Dream has been a wonderful blessing as a tool to learn code. I am so happy to be a part of the dream, and to one day give back to people who are in my current position. 
          The Mentors are great, the program is great, and I am aspiring to one day be great too.
